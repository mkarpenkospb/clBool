aoc: Compiling for FPGA. This process may take several hours to complete.  Prior to performing this compile, be sure to check the reports to ensure the design will meet your performance targets.  If the reports indicate performance targets are not being met, code edits may be required.  Please refer to the Intel FPGA SDK for OpenCL Best Practices Guide for information on performance tuning applications for FPGAs.
aoc: Warning: A timing failure has been detected in the outputted binary. There were 17 timing violations,
with the worst one being a Setup failure of 2563ps on clock:
 board_inst|mem|ddr4|ddr4a|ddr4a|arch|arch_inst|pll_inst|phy_clk[1]                    
Consider doing one or more of the following:
  - Recompiling with a different seed (using -seed=<S>).
  - Reducing the area usage of your design.

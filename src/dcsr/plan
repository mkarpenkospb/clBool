1. Artem Khoroshev's implementation

Division on two parts: count and fill.
count -- https://github.com/YaccConstructor/RedisGraph/blob/6d55594326d9f2b4868540498837186f645df564/deps/cfpq/algorithms/cuda/nsparse/include/detail/merge.h#L19

exec_merge_count

input: A and B matrices, represented by
A: const rpt_a, const col_a,
B: const rpt_b, const col_b,

output: matrix C, in "count" represented by
C: rpt_c, because we only want to know each row size.

exec_merge_fill -- col_c appears to fill it


we can test both cases.
